{"name":"Marcus Carr","tagline":"Project Portfolio","body":"# Data Science\r\n\r\nMy favorite parts of grad school were when I could finally sit down, dig through the data I had collected, and try to make sense of it all. Afterwards, I got curious about what can be done with much, much larger data sets and started digging into data science. Most of this work has been through Coursera ([my profile](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/bfcc111af23f39f585a38674d8efbf3b)), as well as UC Berkeley's [Intro CS: CS61A](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp13/) series. \r\n\r\nI used Python in graduate school, and Python is also the main language in CS61A. The Coursera work has been in R. At my day job, we use a little bit of SQL.\r\n\r\n## Coursera Data Science Specialization\r\n\r\nThe [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) is a collection of nine 4-week courses and a capstone project. Most of the courses have associated mini-projects. I've completed eight of the nine, and the mini-projects are posted at [my GitHub](https://github.com/marcuscarr).\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\nTwo projects in progress, one focused on visualizing geographic data and the other on exercise habits gleaned from social media. Coming soon!\r\n\r\n# Research\r\n\r\nI was a PhD student with [Judith Klinman](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/jukgrp/klinman_group/Home.html) in the [Department of Chemistry](http://chemistry.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). \r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\n* Cody A.
