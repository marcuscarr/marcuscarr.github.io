{"name":"Marcus Carr","tagline":"Project Portfolio","body":"# Data Science\r\n\r\nMy favorite parts of grad school were when I could finally sit down, dig through the data I had collected, and try to make sense of it all. Afterwards, I got curious about what can be done with much, much larger data sets and started improving my data science skill set. Most of this work has been through Coursera ([my profile](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/bfcc111af23f39f585a38674d8efbf3b)), as well as UC Berkeley's [Intro CS: CS61A](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp13/) series. \r\n\r\nI used Python in graduate school, and Python is also the main language in CS61A. The Coursera work has been in R. At my day job, we use a little bit of SQL. I've also passed the [Goethe Institut](http://www.goethe.de)'s [C2-level](http://www.goethe.de/lrn/prj/pba/bes/nc2/enindex.htm) German proficiency exam.\r\n\r\n## Coursera Data Science Specialization\r\n\r\nThe [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1) is a collection of nine 4-week courses and a capstone project. Most of the courses have associated mini-projects. The mini-projects are posted at [my GitHub](https://github.com/marcuscarr).\r\n\r\nOne project explores the built-in `trees` data set in R. You can [read](http://www.camarcuscarr.com/DSS9-Pitch/index.html#1) about the app and [try it](https://codith.shinyapps.io/trees-app/) for yourself.\r\n\r\nIn another [project](http://www.camarcuscarr.com/DSS8-MachineLearning/writeup.html), I built a machine learning algorithm to categorize motion tracker data.\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\nTwo projects in progress, one focused on visualizing geographic data and the other on exercise habits gleaned from social media. Coming soon!\r\n\r\n# Biochemistry Research\r\n\r\nI was a PhD student with [Judith Klinman](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/jukgrp/klinman_group/Home.html) in the [Department of Chemistry](http://chemistry.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu). Broadly speaking, I studied biochemistry and structural biology. More specifically, the structure and kinetics of a couple lipoxygenases. Some of the structures have been deposited to the PDB: [4WFO](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/structidSearch.do?structureId=4WFO), [4WHA](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=4WHA).\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\n* Cody A.
