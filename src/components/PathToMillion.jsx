            <p>To sell the business for <strong>$1,000,000 in 3 years</strong>, we need roughly $250k–$300k in annual profit.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="path-item">
            <h3>The Math</h3>
            <p>We only need <strong>20 to 25 "Anchor" accounts</strong> (busy shops) ordering weekly to hit that profit goal.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="path-item">
            <h3>The Exit</h3>
            <p>Buyers (distributors or larger food brands) love "Dry Mix" companies because they have <strong>high margins</strong> and <strong>"sticky" customers</strong> who can't easily change their base recipe.</p>
